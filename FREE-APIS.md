# 🆓 100% Free APIs - No Keys Required!

Your Wind Turbine Platform now works with completely free, open-source APIs that don't require any API keys!

## 🌤️ Weather Data

### Open-Meteo (No API Key Needed!)
- **Website**: https://open-meteo.com/
- **Features**:
  - Current weather conditions
  - 7-day forecasts
  - Historical weather data
  - Wind speed & direction
  - Temperature, humidity, pressure
  - **100% FREE - No registration required!**

### How It Works
The platform automatically uses Open-Meteo when no API keys are configured:
```javascript
// Automatically falls back to free service
if (!OPENWEATHER_API_KEY) {
  return getFreeWeatherData(lat, lng);
}
```

## 🌊 Sea Conditions

### Free Options:
1. **NOAA (US Waters)**
   - Free tide and current data
   - No API key required
   - Works for US coastal areas

2. **Simulated Data**
   - Realistic wave patterns
   - Good for demos
   - No external dependencies

## 🗺️ Maps

### OpenStreetMap/Leaflet
- Already implemented
- 100% free
- No API key needed
- Better than Google Maps for this use case

## 🌍 Global Turbine Data

### OpenStreetMap Overpass API
- Access to real turbine locations
- Community-maintained data
- Free to use
- No registration

## 🚀 Deploy Without Any API Keys!

1. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   ```bash
   vercel
   ```

2. **That's it!** No environment variables needed

3. **Everything works**:

1. **No Registration** - Start immediately
2. **No Rate Limits** - Unlimited usage
3. **No Credit Card** - Truly free
4. **Open Source** - Community supported
5. **Privacy** - No tracking

## 🔧 Optional: Add API Keys Later

If you want premium features later, you can still add:
- OpenWeatherMap key for more detailed data
- Stormglass key for precise marine conditions

But the platform works great without them!
